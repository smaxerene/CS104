            including defaults, collections, No Asset Procedure, judgments or

            <br><br>
            This report is designed for entry level positions or those that do 
            not require formal qualifications.  It is suitable in circumstances 
            where the employee will be engaged in duties that involve regular 
            day-to-day contact with the public and/or limited financial responsibility.
            <br><br>
            On its own, the value of this report is limited by its historical 
            reference and it is rarely useful for overseas applicants or those 
            who have only lived in New Zealand for a short time because these 
            individuals are unlikely to feature significantly in New Zealand 
            databases and records. 
            <br><br>
            For overseas applicants, PVL recommends the Professional Enquiry 
            as it extends to offshore databases and public records.</p>

            The Integrity Enquiry is considered to be a key element of any verification

            The questionnaire is a non-invasive computer generated test. 
            It is fully automated and engages candidates in a series of 
            predetermined questions. 
            <br><br>
            Responses are measured by means of progressive technology that
            detects attempts at distortion, impression management and other 
            countermeasures. 
            <br><br>
            <b>This test has a very high validity of 0.92 in comparative testing 
            with polygraph examinations</b> on each of the above constructs. You 
            can administer this test in your own office and receive the results 
            in less than a day.
            <br><br>
            The test takes 15-25 minutes to complete.
            <br><br>
            This Integrity Test is in use around the world with more than 12,000 
            administered every month for pre employment screening purposes. Only 
            PVL can offer this test in New Zealand, and the Asia-Pacific region.
            <br><br>
            In the event that the candidate is not available to undertake the test 
            (i.e. living overseas or an out-of-town applicant) then we can send them a 
            written questionnaire to complete. The answers provide us with an opportunity 
            to subject the candidate’s language to Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN).

            The test saves you time by quickly screening out unsuitable 
            candidates right from the start, before you even consider their 
            application for employment.
            <br><br>
            If you later request either of our Integrity, Professional or 
            Personal Enquiries for the applicant we will waive this fee and only 
            invoice you for the specific screening package you request.
            <br><br>
            Many of our clients are using this test because of the delay in the 
            Ministry of Justice processing criminal records checks (as much as a month).
            <br><br>
            If you can't afford to wait a month, this test will give you reassurance 
            about your hiring decision, while we wait for the results of the criminal 
            records check to be returned to us</p>

            &#x2022; We investigate any disciplinary proceedings instituted by a professional 
            regulatory body that may have been heard,  or are pending;
            <br>
            &#x2022; We examine the records of the Insolvency and Trustee Service to confirm the 
            candidate has not been banned in New Zealand from being a Manager or Director of a 
            company.  If there has been a ban,  we investigate the circumstances which led to it 
            and the duration of the prohibition.
            <br>
            &#x2022; We cross reference the candidate’s name with international databases, 
            including law enforcement records, criminal records, records of violence, sex crimes, 
            crimes of dishonesty, diploma mills and unaccredited universities (largest database in 
            the world), database of employers willing to issue false documentation to employees, 
            banned companies, global terrorist databases and US Government foreign asset control 
            databases.
            <br>
            &#x2022; We also conduct a search of international media reports.  Sixty percent of the 
            content in this database, which comprises more than 15,000 newspapers and magazine, is 
            not available on the free web.
            <br><br>
            This enquiry is important for positions where tertiary qualifications are required,  
            it is particularly relevant for overseas applicants as investigations extend to foreign 
            public records and databases,  and it is especially suited to positions in management.

        <p>The purpose of this enquiry is to focus on the candidate’s character.  
            We are looking for specific and conclusive evidence of honesty,  integrity,  
            reliability and trustworthiness.
            <br><br>
            For this report we interview a minimum of two referees,  in person wherever 
            possible.  It is our experience that useful meaningful information can rarely 
            be acquired without personal face-to-face interviews.  However we recognise 
            that each case has to be considered individually and there may be constraints,  
            such as cost and the accessibility of referees,  which mean compromises have to 
            be made.  The more interviews we conduct the more extensive the investigation but 
            we would not recommend more than four unless the earlier interviews brought to 
            light an issue requiring further investigation.
            <br><br>
            Based on the results of the interviews,  we may recommend a personal interview 
            and/or ask that the applicant complete a statement to be subjected to SCAN 
            analysis.
            <br><br>
            In addition,  we search Government databases to see if the Candidate might have 
            any conflicts of interest through their recorded involvement in other companies.
            <br><br>
            This enquiry is recommended for managerial, executive and board appointments,
