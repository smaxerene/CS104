            <div><h3>Craig Gubbins</h3></div>
            <div><p>Principal</p></div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I was born in Wellington and graduated in 1979 from Victoria 
                University of Wellington with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 
                Psychology and Education. In 1980 I joined the New Zealand 
                Security Intelligence Service (SIS) as an Intelligence Officer.  
                I remained employed by the SIS for 26 years before retiring in 2006. 
                During this period my career involved the widest range of intelligence 
                work and I represented and spoke on behalf of the New Zealand Government 
                both at home and abroad.
                <br><br>
                In the mid 1990’s I established the New Zealand Immigration Service's
                Intelligence Unit.  Its task then, as it is now, is to monitor, 
                analyse, report and advise on illegal immigration practices and abuses 
                of New Zealand's immigration policies.
                <br><br>
                I later managed the New Zealand Government's Security Vetting 
                programme, being responsible for the development of Government 
                vetting policies and procedures.  My staff undertook more than 5,000 
                security vettings annually and it was my responsibility to determine 
                and assess the trustworthiness and reliability of every CEO appointed
                by the Government to head all its departments and agencies.
                <br><br>
                I offer a full polygraph examination service in New Zealand. I attended 
                the Missouri Law Enforcement Academy, am a graduate of the United States
                National Polygraph Academy, a member of the American Polygraph Association, 
                and the Missouri Polygraph Association.
                <br><br>
                I am the only US-trained Polygraph Examiner in New Zealand. I am available 
                to travel throughout the country to undertake confidential polygraph 
                examinations on all issues, including marital, fidelity, family sexual abuse 
                allegations, pre-employment, criminal, legal, civil litigation, employment disputes 
                and fraud allegations. My entire profesional working life (43 years) has involved
                establishing the truth.
                <br><br>
                I have completed additional professional development and training for administering 
                polygraph examinations to convicted sex offenders and I am certified by the United 
                States National Polygraph Academy to undertake post-conviction sex offender testing (PCSOT).
                <br><br>
                I am a certified practicing Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN) analyst, having 
                completed training in Canberra, and advanced instruction at the Headquarters of 
                the Laboratory for Scientific Interrogation, in Phoenix, Arizona. I am retained 
                by the New Zealand Government to undertake the forensic analysis of written and 
                spoken statements for evidence of deception</p>

        <div>
            <p>I was born in South Africa and as a young child, emigrated to New Zealand
                with my parents and grew up in Rotorua.  I have a BA in History as well as 
                a degree in Law from the University of Auckland.
                <br><br>
                My working life has been spent in finance and administration, including 
                the Development Finance Corporation, the Auckland High Court Law Library 
                and PricewaterhouseCoopers, before establishing PVL.
                <br><br>
                I have a particular interest in equity and ethics and their professional
                application in the business environment and believe PVL is a vehicle for 
                rewarding honesty and integrity in candidates, and for encouraging ethical 
                business practices.
                <br><br>
                Craig and I have been partners in life, and business, for 24 years</p>
